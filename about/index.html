                    <h2>Life before coding (I know, crazy to think about, right?)</h2>
                    <p>I never once thought that I would enter the world of STEM. I have always tended toward humanities classes and thought that, while I had a wide variety of interests, that I would be more of the "artist" type above all else.</p>
                    <h2>How it Started</h2>
                    <p>It all started with a TV chef who I watched religiously throughout high school. Her name is Rachel Khoo, and she truly embodied everything I wanted from life: she worked out of her tiny, Parisian apartment, wore colorful, vintage clothes, and illustrated her life with delicate watercolor. </p>
                    <p>Then, one day, she began talking about coding. She said that she owed a large portion of her success to a website called "Skillcrush" and that this was the foundation of her web-design career. Her website began to change, looking far more professional than her blog had been previously.</p>
                    <p>After hearing about Rachel Khoo's coding endeavors, there came a massive uptick in STEM-related advertising&hyphen; Karlie Kloss started a coding school for girls (see <a href="https://www.kodewithklossy.com/">Code with Klossy</a>) and suddenly it seemed like girls really could make a place for themselves in tech.With that being said though, I did not take to coding the first time around. I thought it was super fun, but I did not have the energy to commit to coding full-time (especially since I was already a student).</p>
                    </p>
                    <h2>How it's going</h2>
                    <p>Coding has truly changed my life. I'm able to decide my own work schedule and spend more time with my family, which is the reason I took it up in the first place! I no longer owe every moment of my productive time to an employer, but rather to myself.</p>
